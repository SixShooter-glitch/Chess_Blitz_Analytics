 Chess Blitz Analytics

Blitz chess is raw, fast, and unforgiving — it shows how a player thinks under the ticking clock. For me, this project is more than just crunching numbers. It’s about diving into the games of Divya Deshmukh, a player whose creativity, confidence, and resilience make her stand out on the board.

I’ve always found something magnetic about her blitz games on Chess.com. Even in short time controls, she manages to combine sharp calculation with calm precision — and that’s what inspired me to build this project.

 Acknowledgments

This project is fueled by my admiration for Divya Deshmukh. She’s not just one of India’s brightest chess talents — her games carry a spark that makes you want to watch closer, analyze deeper, and learn from her style.

Her blitz games, in particular, are fascinating:

She’s fearless in experimenting with openings.

She fights back even in tough positions.

And most importantly, she plays with a confidence that makes blitz exciting to follow.

For me, studying her games isn’t just about statistics — it’s about celebrating the energy and brilliance she brings to chess.
